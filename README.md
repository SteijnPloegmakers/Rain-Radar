In the ViewNavigation Folder you can see the ContentView.swift, and that is where you can find the standard List of favorites can be found.

The List shows all the existing favourites and in the TextField you can fill in a new name for the Favourite and add it with the Button under there.
When you press the button to add the review it will update the List of favorites in real-time, and you will see the newly added favorite there.

In the FavoritesDetailView you will find a simple TextBox with the name of the favorite you pressed, and with a button to remove that favourite.
When you remove the favorite you will automatically get routed back to the FavoritesView and the favoite you removed will not be there anymore.
